'''
Module to simulate synthetic data for testing inference methods.

Simulate stochastic reaction network models using the gillespie algorithm to
produce stationary samples emulating single-cell RNA sequencing observations.
Simulate datatsets of samples from large numbers of genes by sampling model
parameters from distributions fitted to match observed data.
