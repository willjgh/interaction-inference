# interaction-inference

Python package implementing an optimization based inference method to detect interaction between pairs of genes from cellular observations, together with tools for simulation of synthetic datasets and visualizations of performance.

For current research on the method applied to interaction detection see the repository [here](https://github.com/willjgh/M5R), and for an in depth explanation of the general optimization approach see my [MSci thesis](https://github.com/willjgh/Year-4-Project/blob/master/Report/01844345_WH.pdf).

## Installation

Package will hopefully soon be available on PyPi and installable through the python package manager pip

```
pip install interaction-inference
```

## Examples

For a brief overiew and example usage of the package see the notebook in the [examples folder](examples/example_notebook.ipynb), which shows how to load or simulate datasets, run analysis methods and compute performance metrics on example data.

## Background

Detailed explanations of the optimization approach and interaction problem are available through the links above, but I provide a simple explanation of the background.
